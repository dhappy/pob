# Proof of Blackness

A project to create an analogue to [Proof of Humanity](//www.proofofhumanity.id) where would-be entrants create a video attesting to their fittingness for being members of Yggdrasil's Black team which is responsible for the distribution of substances, illicit and pharmeceutical.

There are 13 teams, each of which is tasked with the management of an essential need. Ultimately, there are 13 sets of characteristics which are shared by the 13 teams. More detail about the sets is in [13 13s](https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/blob/master/13-13s.md#thirteen-thirteens).
